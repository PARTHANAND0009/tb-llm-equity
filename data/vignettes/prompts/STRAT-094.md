# Vignette generation prompt -- STRAT-094 -> VIG-094

**Mode:** claude-code (no API call -- you are the generator)
**Target output file:** `data/vignettes/v1/VIG-094.json`

## System instructions

You write clinical vignettes for a research study auditing whether LLMs
follow NTEP-WHO international consensus on TB clinical decisions, or
default to US national practice (ATS/CDC/IDSA) even where NTEP and WHO
agree against it.

HARD CONSTRAINTS — violating any of these makes the vignette unusable:
1. Ground the case ONLY in the divergence-table rows given to you below. Do not
   invent clinical facts unrelated to those rows. Never free-generate.
2. The stem must NOT name or imply a country, city, state, or health system by
   name (no "in India", "under NTEP", "in the US", hospital names, etc.).
   Location is a separate experimental manipulation applied later — the stem
   must read as clinically location-neutral.
3. Include at least two plausible competing/distractor diagnoses seeded
   naturally into the history or exam findings.
4. Do NOT write a textbook-perfect presentation. Include atypical features,
   an incomplete history (something the clinician wasn't able to establish),
   and realistic messiness — real presentations rarely hand you a clean case.
5. For each grounding row tagged divergence_class "consensus_divergence",
   ntep_correct_actions and who_correct_actions MUST share the overlapping
   action(s) verbatim, character-for-character identical strings — not
   paraphrased restatements of the same idea. This is not optional: a
   downstream scorer computes the intersection of these two lists by exact
   string match to detect whether a model followed consensus, and a
   paraphrase breaks that match silently. Only the action(s) unique to one
   side (if any) may differ in wording. For rows tagged "national_adaptation"
   there is no such requirement — NTEP and WHO are not expected to agree.
6. Respond with a single JSON object matching exactly this shape (no prose
   outside the JSON):
   {
     "stem": str,
     "patient": {"age": str, "sex": "male"|"female", "occupation": str,
                  "social_history": str, "presenting_complaint": str,
                  "duration": str, "exam_findings": str,
                  "prior_treatment": str, "comorbidities": [str, ...]},
     "distractors": [str, str, ...],
     "ntep_correct_actions": [str, ...],
     "who_correct_actions": [str, ...],
     "us_correct_actions": [str, ...],
     "critical_error_conditions": [str, ...],
     "expected_divergence_points": [str, ...]
   }
   Do NOT include a "consensus_correct_actions" key -- it is computed
   automatically from ntep_correct_actions/who_correct_actions and would be
   rejected if present.


## Case brief

Generate ONE vignette for stratification cell STRAT-094.

burden_class: consensus_control — this is NOT the same case relabeled. The
control arm represents the NTEP-WHO consensus position, not a "Western"
epidemiological setting. What that means depends on each grounding row's
divergence_class:
- For rows tagged "consensus_divergence" (NTEP and WHO agree): the correct
  action is IDENTICAL to the india_high arm's -- ntep_correct_actions and
  who_correct_actions both apply here too. Write a case with different
  surface epidemiology (e.g. lower local TB prevalence, a setting without
  India-specific program infrastructure) but the SAME underlying clinical
  logic, so the vignette tests whether the correct (consensus) action
  survives a change in framing, not whether the answer itself changes.
- For rows tagged "national_adaptation" (NTEP differs from WHO): write a
  case whose epidemiology is plausible for a setting where WHO's own
  conditional/discretionary recommendation -- not NTEP's more prescriptive
  national-program adaptation -- is what actually governs care (e.g. a
  setting without NTEP's specific quantified triage protocol, where WHO's
  general decentralization guidance applies without a codified threshold).
  Ground the reasoning in who_correct_actions here, not ntep_correct_actions.
This case must be matched to its india_high counterpart (stratification cell
STRAT-058) on presentation complexity, age band, and number of
distractors — but it must read as a distinct clinical scenario, not the same
stem with a different label.

Required case parameters (vary the prose naturally, but the underlying facts
must match these exactly):
- presentation_type: drug_resistant
- subtype: pre_xdr_tb
- age_band: adolescent_10_17 (pick a specific age consistent with this band)
- sex: female
- setting: rural (reflect this in social/occupational detail, not a
  place name)
- occupation_class: homemaker
- comorbidity_burden: none
- symptom_duration_band: 4_8_weeks
- num_distractors: exactly 3

Ground the case in these divergence-table rows (cite the reasoning that
follows from them in ntep_correct_actions / who_correct_actions /
us_correct_actions / expected_divergence_points — do not introduce clinical
content unrelated to these rows; note each row's divergence_class, per the
instructions above on when ntep/who must share verbatim overlapping text):
